<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was really quite enjoyable. I love the process of moving a wireframe that I made on paper to an actual website viewable in my browser. In this challenege we didn't start with the wireframe but the feelings still hold true. Some of this was tedious (copying all the content from the BH website) but it was good practice.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

This was interesting! I am a language learner (Persian and Chinese) and I think that's why I had so much fun learning about semantics. I like to know how languages work and how to be precise with communication. Furthermore, I enjoy reading well-written technical documentation. I relied heavily on w3schools to help me understand semantic HTML5 elements.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I think my pair and I did well in this regard. We avoided the use of CSS and of HTML elements that can be acheived with CSS, like the <strong> tag. We stuck to structure. We used the HTML validator tool to confirm we had used best practices. We only encountered one error which was easily resolved. Specifically, we forgot to include the alt="" attribute in the <img> element for the GEICO logo image.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good:
- Really helpful to define and understand content structure. Contributes to a well organized site.

Bad:
- Can be tedious.
- Not pretty.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I don't really have a trick. I do have a tip, though: practice writing HTML frequently and DO NOT copy and paste. Just as I leanred git using the git crash course, which requires you to type the same commands over and over, so must we write HTML over and over.

Of course, I usually have a handy HTML reference open when I need it. My current favorite is w3schools Complete HTML Reference: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp.
