#4.2 Number, Letters, and Variable Assignments

##What does puts do?

<code>puts</code> will simply print the output to the console on a new line. It does not return anything.

##What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a number without decimals. e.g.: 1, 900, and -53562 are all integers.

A float is a number with decimals. e.g.: 1.49, 53.90, and -0.312 are all floats.


##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

*Note: I assume the reader doesn't know anything about programming but s/he does know basic mathematics terminology.*

Integer division will always return integers. Even if we would expect an operation to return a quotient with a decimal, integer divison will only return an integer. In these cases, the resulting quotient will always be rounded down. i.e.: <code>9/4 = 4</code>.
