#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

##1. Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

Concept: Meditation has many powerful benefits such as:

- better focus
- less anxiety
- more compassion, gratitude, creativity, and patience

Concept: Large victories are achieved by taking small, consistent, and focused action. “Big doors hang on small hinges.” This is especially true when starting new habits or skills. Start the behavior first and then your attitude will change. “Fake it ’til you make it.” “Baby steps.” “Little by little, day by day.” (Tiny Habits, Fogg Method, Minimum Viable Product.)

Concept: Focus on enjoying the process of developing your skill, not so much on the results of having learned your skill. (I think about how I learned to snowboard, how to speak Chinese and Persian, and how I learned guitar.)

Concept: Pomodoro technique leverages Time Boxing. The Pomodoro technique:

- uses 25-minute periods of work separated by small breaks, and one longer break every four pomodoros;
- is scheduled, brief breaks helps prevent burnout;
- helps you stay focused on task by allowing you to jot down distracting thoughts to be dealt with later.

##2. What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

A time management and productivity technique. Time Boxing requires one to use a specific time period to focus on work rather than a specific deliverable. i.e. "We will work on this task for 30 minutes, review what we’ve accomplished, and then decide how to move forward." rather than “We will work on this deliverable until we complete x, y and z.” Pomodoro technique is a specific application of Time Boxing.

Through out Phase 0, I will implement the Pomodoro technique. I have already installed the Mac App "Pomodoro Time.” There are other implementations of Pomodoro that might work better for you and your set up. I will use Pomodoro with every task I take on and I will commit to honoring the scheduled breaks. I have burnt out before because of over-working and I will be vigilant to prevent repeating that experience.

##3. How do you manage your time currently?

If any of this sounds familiar, it may be because I am using the principles described in Stephen Covey’s [“Seven Habits for Highly Effective People.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktlTxC4QG8g)  The whole book is extremely useful. One concept that is particular relevant to this reflection is Covey’s [time management matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODyG5lKbH08).

I have created a vision for myself and I have identified several roles I play in life such as: brother, son, husband, community member, professional etc. From this vantage point I have distilled a few high priority goals that I want to achieve. I think these goals will contribute to realizing my vision.  Every Monday morning I consider this question: “What would have the most impact on achieving my goals if I got it done this week?” I make a list of what comes to mind, considering the question for each of my goals. I make it a priority to accomplish these tasks first. At this time I also make a list of all the other tasks that need to be accomplished—spending time with family, maintaining physical assets (car, apartment, etc), exercise and so on. Now that I have a clearer understanding of the tasks I choose to do this week, the time they require, and their deadlines, I can begin to plan my week.

I use Google Calendar as my planner. I have one calendar for each of my roles and each calendar has a different color. This way I am able to get a quick understanding of where I am investing my time throughout the week. Also, it’s very easy for me to adjust appointments—so it is very flexible. Case in point, this morning I had planned to get my car repaired at 8 a.m. However, a high priority and urgent conversation arose and I knew that repairing the car could wait a few hours. So, I decided to stay in the conversation and give it my full attention, confident that the repairs would get done today. On Google Calendar, I simply adjusted all my appointments in response to the important conversation in less than a minute--take that, pencil and paper! Fortunately, these appointments are all flexible. Google Calendar is also mobile and up-to-date. It syncs across all my devices AND I share it with my wife so she knows what’s happening in my life this week.

##4. Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

In short, yes. However, there are challenges to allowing the strategy to work, the largest of these being discipline. The strategy works well when I take the time to plan my week on Mondays. If I miss this step, the week can definitely get away from me and I may end up feeling scattered and feeling like I have no idea how I spent my time. So, the linch pin of this strategy is to actually take the time to plan my week.

##5. Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

Yes! See my answer for #2, above for implementing Time Boxing. Also, I used to have a frequent meditation practice but I have fallen out of it. I have made an action step for myself to practice meditation for only one minute in the mornings when I wake up. Baby steps!

##6. What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

See my answer for #3. In summary:
On Monday mornings, I will plan my week. I will review briefly my vision and goals. I will review my roles. I will generate a list of tasks I wish to accomplish for the week and categorize them into the four quadrants. Some of the recurring tasks will be: exercise, buy groceries, prepare meals, get into nature, connect with family and friends, schedule DBC weekly assignments and challenges from Canvas (including GPS, peer pairing, feedback, quiz, reflection etc.), clean the house, clean the car, review spending and budget, read for growth.

Once the week is planned, I will work my plan while remaining flexible and aware that urgent tasks will likely arise and my plan will likely shift throughout the week.

On Sundays, I will review what I accomplished that week, how I felt during the week and how I feel now, and what I learned. I will leverage this reflection to inform my weekly planning sessions on Mondays.


#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

##What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is a text-based, command line interface which is used to interact with computers. A shell is also a programming language.

“bash” is an implementation of shell used on Unix based computers.

##What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

I found interpreting the manuals to be the most challenging aspect of this material. Understanding and synthesizing the concepts introduced herein was another challenging aspect. It took me some time and experimentation to get a hold of data streams, in particular. Of course, memorizing all the commands in the crash course will take time and effort, but that is not so difficult—just time consuming.

##Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes. The command line crash course was extremely useful, simply designed, and easy to understand. I did have to practice quite a bit and re-read a few sections of the course to get a more solid understanding of some commands. Fortunatley, I was able to successfully use all the commands.

##In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

Based on my very nascent and inexperienced understanding, I feel that the following commands are crucial:

- pwd
- ls
- grep
- find
- man
- cd
- cd ..
- less
- mv
- rm
- cp
- cp -r

##Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does

**- pwd**
print working directory - prints the directory user is currently in.

**- ls**
list directory - lists the contents of the directory.

**- mv**
move directory - moves, or, rather, renames a file or directory

**- cd**
change directory - changes to specified directory

**- ../**
I forgot what this one does. After looking it up, I learned that this command is used with “cd” to move up one directory in the tree.

**- touch**
creates an empty file

**- mkdir**
makes a new directory with specified name

**- less**
displays content of a file, one screen-worth at a time. supports paging fwd and bwd through content.

**- rmdir**
remove directory - removes specified directory. will not remove a directory that contains files.

**- rm**
remove file - removes specified fiel. "rm -r” will recursively remove a file or directory (including subtree)

**- help**
displays helpful information about commonly used commands. you can ask for more specific help by providing a pattern.


#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

##If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?

*Create a new repo*

1. Go to your GitHub profile.
2. Find the "+” button . It is located on the top right corner of the page, to the immediate left of your avatar. When you hover over the button, help text displays:  “Create new…"
3. Click the “+” or “Create new…" button.
4. Click “New repository”.
5. You have a few options to configure your new repository:
  1. Enter a name for your new repo. Make it short and memorable.
  2. Select your preferred visibility: Public or Private.
  3. Add an MIT License.
6. Click the “Create repository” button.
7. You have successfully created a repository.

*Fork a repo*

1. On GitHub, navigate to the target repo that you want to fork.
2. Once you’re in the repo, find the “Fork” button. It is located in the top right corner, immediately below your avatar.
3. Click the “Fork” button.
4. You may be prompted to choose where to Fork the target repo. Make your choice.
5. You have successfully forked a repo.

*Clone a repo*

1. Find the target repo’s clone URL.
  1. Navigate to the repo in GitHub.
  2. Once there, find the column on the right hand side—the one with options Code, Pull requests, Settings etc.
  3. Locate the “HTTPS clone URL” label in this column.
  4. Copy the provided URL
2. Open a new shell window.
3. Change to the directory where you want to clone the target repo.
4. Execute the following command: git clone [URL]. Replace [URL] with the clone URL of the target repo that you just copied.
5. You should now have a clone of the target repo in the directory that you chose. Use the ls command to confirm.

##Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

I would fork a repo because I want to copy all of its contents to my profile. Once I fork a repo, I can make all the changes I want to its contents independent of the original repo. Furthermore, if my modifications are approved, I can submit a pull request to have my work merged with the original repo. Creating a new repo will not copy the contents for me.

##What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

Fortunately, I did not encounter any struggles when setting up git and GitHub. I did have to clarify the difference between “forking” and “creating” repos.

#1.5 Tracking Changes Reflection

##How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?

##What is a commit?
A snapshot of changes up to that moment. It's like "saving" your work.

##What are the best practices for commit messages?
Use imperative, present tense.
Add a description in the first line up to 51 characters.
Leave an empty line and then provide a more detailed explanation of the changes purpose and how behavior of the program or file changes as a result.

##What does the HEAD^ argument mean?
This is the commit just before the commit you just made. If you want to move even further back in commits, you can use HEAD~3, HEAD~4, and so on.

##What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?

**modified** = A vesion of a file that has been changed but not staged.

**staged** = all modifications that have been added to the staging area.

**committed** = all staged modifications that have been committed.

Add files that have been modified to the staging area:

> git add [filename]


Commit modified files:

> git commmit -v *or* git commit -m "*description of change*"

Bring a committed file back to staging:

> git reset --soft HEAD^


##Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?

**Check status of changes**

> git status

**Make and move to a new feature-branch**

> git checkout -b *branch-name*

**Add files that have been modified to the staging area:**

> git add [filename]

**Commit modified files:**

> git commmit -v *or* git commit -m "*description of change*"

**Bring a committed file back to staging:**

> git reset --soft HEAD^

**Delete a branch**

> git branch -d *branch-name*

**Push commits to remote repo**

> git push origin *branch-name*


##What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?



##Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?
